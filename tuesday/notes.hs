-- Basically, reverse input and output.

-- The converse of "If it is raining then the grass is wet" is "If the grass is

-- Regarding the use of Maybe:
-- "The Maybe type encapsulates an optional value. A value of type Maybe a either
-- contains a value of type a (represented as Just a), or it is empty (represented
-- as Nothing). Using Maybe is a good way to deal with errors or exceptional cases
-- without resorting to drastic measures such as error."
